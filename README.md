# Python-Project-Easy-Calculator

This Python code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, divide two numbers. It looks like a standard calculator with raised buttons that lower when clicked. It uses the module 'math' to perform the calculations, and it imports most modules from the package 'tkinter' to create features that interact with the user.
